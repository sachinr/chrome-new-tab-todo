Show a todo list on Chrome's new tab page. The todo list items are synced with a Dropbox datastore so that the data is available across multiple platforms.

### Features

- Tasks are rendered using GitHub Flavoured Markdown
- Drafts are saved to local storage (don't lose you idea when closing the tab by mistake)
- Tasks are synced with your Dropbox account using the [Dropbox Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore)
- Bookmarks from the bookmark bar are displayed

### Todo

- Display nested bookmark folders
- Sort tasks
- Complete tasks instead of deleting them
- Edit list title
- Show assigned GitHub Issues
